	abstract = {The publishing processes and standards in scholarly journals are much better known than those of the publishers of scholarly books. Since scholarly books are key channels of communication and academic assessment in the humanities and social sciences, information provided by publishers concerning their publishing processes is very important both for authors and panelists (at funding and evaluation agencies). This article focuses on the analysis of the transparency of publishers in relation to the information they offer to authors. The main objective is to identify and analyze the publishing practices of two hundred scholarly book publishers of social sciences and humanities with respect to the information that they provide on their Web sites about their publishing processes. A lack of information on these Web sites is the main finding of the study. Among Spanish publishers, only 11.2 per cent explicitly state that they have a review system by experts. At the international level, the situation improves, but the shortcomings are still evident. Some guidelines for publishers are outlined and proposed.},

	abstract = {Books are a key channel in the scientific communication processes for researchers in Social Sciences and Humanities. Although the best way of assessing the monographs would involve its individualized reading, this method is practically unfeasible both in terms of cost and time. An indicator which could be used is the prestige of the publisher of monographs and it is essential to take into account the academy’s opinion to determine it. This article reports a survey launched to 11,647 lecturers and Spanish researchers, with a response rate of 26\%, in which the respondents were asked to point those quality indicators they consider the most relevant for books as well as their opinion on the quality of publishers. As the main results, there are reported the top-rated publishers, as well as the characteristics which, according to the respondents’ opinion, determine their quality; among these characteristics, stands out the fact of counting with an assessment system with external reviewers. Regarding the list of publishers, it is also explained the indicator which allows its ranking. It is also defended the use of the results in the form of categorization.},

	abstract = {The prospects of altmetrics are especially encouraging for research fields in the humanities that currently are difficult to study using established bibliometric methods. Yet, little is known about the altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. Consequently, this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of humanities-oriented articles and books published by Swedish universities during 2012. Some of the most common altmetric sources are examined using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. Mendeley has the highest coverage of journal articles (61 \%) followed by Twitter (21 \%) while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on Facebook. Books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both Mendeley’s and the novel data source Library Thing’s coverage is low. Many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of non-English language publications. However, the continuing development and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.},

	abstract = {Hedging generally refers to linguistic expressions such as ‘I think’, ‘maybe’ and ‘possible’, which qualify statements as opinion rather than fact and reduce their force. Previous studies have shown the importance of hedging in academic writing and have highlighted cross-linguistic and disciplinary differences. Drawing on previous studies, the paper investigates praise in book reviews, an under-investigated area of research. It specifically explores how praise is hedged differently in English and Japanese and the relevance of syntactic devices in the analysis of hedging. The study has shown that praise was hedged more frequently in Japanese book reviews and that, although syntactic devices per se did not appear to significantly qualify as hedging, a combination of lexical terms and syntactic devices appeared to manifest different interpersonal strategies in each language. The study suggests that the higher frequency of hedging in praise and impersonal syntactic structures found in Japanese book reviews may be related to Japanese norms of politeness and writers’ wishes to remain non-committal as evaluators. On the other hand, in English writing, the lower frequency of hedging in praise and the tendency to use personal syntactic structures may be related to positive politeness and writers’ willingness to take responsibilities as evaluators.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the open-identity label, i.e., the practice of disclosing reviewers’ names in published scholarly books, a common practice in Central and Eastern European countries. This study’s objective is to verify whether the open-identity label is a type of peer-review label (like those used in Finland and Flanders, i.e., the Flemish part of Belgium), and as such, whether it can be used as a delineation criterion in various systems used to evaluate scholarly publications. We have conducted a two-phase sequential explanatory study. In the first phase, interviews with 20 of the 40 largest Polish publishers of scholarly books were conducted to investigate how Polish publishers control peer reviews and whether the open-identity label can be used to identify peer-reviewed books. In the other phase, two questionnaires were used to analyze perceptions of peer-review and open-identity labelling among authors (n = 600) and reviewers (n = 875) of books published by these 20 publishers. Integrated results allowed us to verify publishers’ claims concerning their peer-review practices. Our findings reveal that publishers actually control peer reviews by providing assessment criteria to reviewers and sending reviews to authors. Publishers rarely ask for permission to disclose reviewers’ names, but it is obvious to reviewers that this practice of disclosing names is part of peer reviewing. This study also shows that only the names of reviewers who accepted manuscripts for publication are disclosed. Thus, most importantly, our analysis shows that the open-identity label that Polish publishers use is a type of peer-review label like those used in Flanders and Finland, and as such, it can be used to identify peer-reviewed scholarly books.},
