	abstract = {We address the diffusion of information about the COVID-19 with a massive data analysis on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab. We analyze engagement and interest in the COVID-19 topic and provide a differential assessment on the evolution of the discourse on a global scale for each platform and their users. We fit information spreading with epidemic models characterizing the basic reproduction numbers \$R\_0\$ for each social media platform. Moreover, we characterize information spreading from questionable sources, finding different volumes of misinformation in each platform. However, information from both reliable and questionable sources do not present different spreading patterns. Finally, we provide platform-dependent numerical estimates of rumors' amplification.},

	abstract = {The goal of content analysis is the systematic examination of communicative material (originally from the mass media in particular). This does not have to consist exclusively of texts: musical, pictorial, plastic or other similar material may also be treated. What is essential, however, is that the communicative material should be fixed or recorded in some form. Content analysis is, of course, a technique that derives from the communication sciences. Today,
however, it claims to be able to serve for systematic analysis in a wide range of scientific domains. Modern content analysis, moreover, no longertargets only the content of verbal material. Both formal aspects and latent meaning content can be also objects of study. The basic idea of a qualitative content analysis, then, consists of maintaining the systematic nature of content analysis for the various stages of qualitative analysis, without undertaking over-hasty quantifications.},

	abstract = {Questo testo prende in analisi il rapporto di reciproca implicazione tra mente e cultura, individuando nelle pratiche del discorso la metaprocedura di produzione di senso che orienta la forma di vita degli esseri umani. La mente come costruzione culturale è in costante rimodulazione attraverso i testi con cui le soggettività - persone, gruppi, istituzioni - negoziano la vasta gamma delle loro interazioni. La psicologia culturale discorsiva ha una chiara matrice semiotica e una valenza eminentemente sociale, perché il suo nucleo problematico è costituito dal nesso Sé-Altro e dalla relazione di fiducia, che determinano i modelli operativi interni all'intersoggettività. La proposta teorico-metodologica argomentata dal testo è arricchita da indagini specifiche sulle retoriche di costruzione dell'identità storica delle comunità, sui repertori interpretativi dei cambiamenti organizzativi, sulle funzioni svolte dalla religiosità nel ciclo di vita e nell'adozione di un'identità di genere, sul vissuto soggettivo del benessere negli incontri interculturali e sul fragile potere della poesia nell'intrecciare sensibilità etica ed estetica.},

	abstract = {The spreading of new Coronavirus in addition to becoming a global phenomenon, following the declaration of a pandemic state, has generated excessive access to information, phenomenon named “Infodemia” (Cinelli et al., 2020). The general purpose of the exploratory study is to investigate how the coronavirus situation is described from the journalistic communication. Starting from La Repubblica online, as a reference journalistic magazine, the study assumes that if the circulation of information helps to create a social representation of the phenomenon, the excessive accessibility to sources of information (infodemia) can be modulated by the “how” the phenomenon is described by the journalists. The methodology proposed is quanti-qualitative (mixed method). A Content Analysis (Mayring, 2004) with the SketchEngine software (Thomas, 2016) is carried out first. In support, a Diatextual Analysis (Papapicco \& Mininni, 2019) was carried out. The results show the presence of the contrast vision about COVID-19 situation in Italy.},

	abstract = {The theoretical and methodological framework of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is a powerful resource to face the ideological intricacies of the public debate on a specific aspect of migrant people: ‘brain exit’. The relevance of brain drain (Docquier and Rapoport 2012) has been explored at several levels; however, the aim of our study is to focus on its significance for Discursive Psychology as well. The way in which it is discussed brings into play the interpretative repertories of basic objects in the organization of the culture of a community, such as ‘work’, ‘family’, ‘education’, ‘Self’, ‘nation’. Our study aims to detect the discursive pathways that oppose the ‘professional realization’ to the ‘emotional enhancement’ as referring to the Self, to the families and to the politicians as well as to the whole community. Starting from various sources of ‘dia-textual’ (Manuti and Mininni and 2017) data, our research aims to evaluate which are the difficulties of this displacement, doubts and victories of brain drain. To satisfy this purpose, a Sentiment Analysis and Diatextual Analysis was carried out, assuming that the courageous choice to leave depends on a high motivation of the worker who sets aside his affections for work satisfaction: not by chance, in English in the binomial ‘brain drain’ and ‘drain heart’, the heart is almost moved to the background. Diatextual Approach as a format of Critical Discourse Analysis answers the need to ‘enlarge the paradigm’, starting from the research question about how the speech represented the social goals and how large their area of influence can be.},

	abstract = {The origin of population-scale coordination has puzzled philosophers and scientists for centuries. Recently, game theory, evolutionary approaches and complex systems science have provided quantitative insights on the mechanisms of social consensus. However, the literature is vast and widely scattered across fields, making it hard for the single researcher to navigate it. This short review aims to provide a compact overview of the main dimensions over which the debate has unfolded and to discuss some representative examples. It focuses on those situations in which consensus emerges ‘spontaneously’ in the absence of centralized institutions and covers topics that include the macroscopic consequences of the different microscopic rules of behavioural contagion, the role of social networks and the mechanisms that prevent the formation of a consensus or alter it after it has emerged. Special attention is devoted to the recent wave of experiments on the emergence of consensus in social systems.},

Several aims run in parallel as the reader undertakes guided discovery tasks: in the process of exploring over three hundred language questions, the reader learns how to use all of the relevant Sketch Engine tools. The tasks cover and uncover aspects of vocabulary, grammar, stylistics, discourse and pragmatics. There are two indices: Index of Names and Notions and the Word Focus Index.Sketch Engine is online software that combines a specialised search engine and many corpora in many languages. The data returned from searches can be presented as concordance lines, collocation lists, word clouds, word sketches, bundles and chunks. The data processing can be at all levels: letters, morphemes, words, clauses, phrases, chunks, sentences and text.},
