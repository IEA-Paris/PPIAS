	abstract = {The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to \#migrants./The project’s objective is to study if (and how) the Covid-19 context affects Twitter contents in relation to migrants in France. It is based on a dataset of 7,586 tweets comprising the hashtag \#migrants, collected during two periods: (i) from President Macron’s announcement of the closure of all education institutions on March 12th, 2020 – the country’s first national lockdown being implemented a few days later, on March 17th – until the beginning of deconfinement on May 11th, 2020, i.e. 60 days; (ii) from October 30th to December 15th, 2020 (2nd national lockdown), i.e. 48 days. It takes an interest in the way the topic of the coronavirus has slotted into Twitter discussions on migrants. The project uses content analysis (qualitative and quantitative approaches).
The project Covid\#Migrants draws upon and extends findings of the project “M-Phasis Migration and Patterns of Hate Speech in Social Media. A Cross-cultural Perspective”, funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France), DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany. Covid\#Migrants is conducted within the Center for Research on Mediations, an interdisciplinary research unit of 230 researchers at the University of Lorraine, France, mainly positioned in the field of Information-Communication and Language.},

	abstract = {The spreading of new Coronavirus in addition to becoming a global phenomenon, following the declaration of a pandemic state, has generated excessive access to information, phenomenon named “Infodemia” (Cinelli et al., 2020). The general purpose of the exploratory study is to investigate how the coronavirus situation is described from the journalistic communication. Starting from La Repubblica online, as a reference journalistic magazine, the study assumes that if the circulation of information helps to create a social representation of the phenomenon, the excessive accessibility to sources of information (infodemia) can be modulated by the “how” the phenomenon is described by the journalists. The methodology proposed is quanti-qualitative (mixed method). A Content Analysis (Mayring, 2004) with the SketchEngine software (Thomas, 2016) is carried out first. In support, a Diatextual Analysis (Papapicco \& Mininni, 2019) was carried out. The results show the presence of the contrast vision about COVID-19 situation in Italy.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3599755},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine how content about the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak changed in the Japanese information environment through a comparison of the topics that were prevalent in traditional media and social media. The paper investigated how the topics of information regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in newspapers and Twitter differed, how the topics in relation to COVID-19 of newspapers and Twitter users changed before and after the WHO pandemic declaration, with the assumptions that topics that are relevant to the central government of Japan are more often found in newspapers, rather than Twitter and topics that are relevant to Japanese families and individuals are more often found in Twitter, rather than newspapers. A total of 10953 newspaper articles and 171,996 tweets before and after the pandemic declaration by the WHO. Instead of employing traditional content analysis methods, this paper analyzed media content through the topicmodels package for R, for classifying the various topics that were prominent before and after the pandemic declaration due to the size of the data accumulated. The analysis of this paper found that Twitter tweets focused more on topics that affect individual or household needs such as medical issues and financial well-being of individuals and families. In contrast newspapers focused more on international topics such as China, U.S. and Europe and topics that involved the government such as the suspension of primary and secondary schools, the economy and the Tokyo Olympic games. Before the pandemic declaration by the WHO, medical topics were found to be prevalent on Twitter whereas newspaper topics were focusing on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantine and the current situation in other countries. After the pandemic declaration, Twitter tweets were about medical topics, but were more focused on the lack of medical supplies and future concerns of hospitals being overwhelmed leading to a collapse of the medical system in Japan. Twitter tweets also centered around hopes of support by the government, such as temporary cash payments. Newspapers on the other hand centered around topics of cancelled sports events and government announcements. The findings of this paper suggest during pandemics, mass media may be insufficient in resolving the discontent towards lack of information and suspicion arises towards the government. Twitter might be used for searching information that is not found in mass media such as newspapers as doubt towards the government rises as illustrated in the findings of this analysis.},
