	abstract = {This paper tests if air pollution serves as a carrier for SARS-CoV-2 by measuring the effect of daily exposure to air pollution on its spread by panel data models that incorporates a possible commonality between municipalities. We show that the contemporary exposure to particle matter is not the main driver behind the increasing number of cases and deaths in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Remarkably, we also find that the cross-dependence between municipalities in the Mexican region is highly correlated to public mobility, which plays the leading role behind the rhythm of contagion. Our findings are particularly revealing given that the Mexico City Metropolitan Area did not experience a decrease in air pollution during COVID-19 induced lockdowns.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses a broad range of macro variables to assess the effects they have on the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. We consider 23 explanatory variables on health, political, and economic factors for 94 countries. Given the vast number of explanatory variables analysed, the paper employs advanced statistical tools for the analysis. We use regularised regression and dimension reduction methods to increase estimation efficiency. We find that alcohol drinking is associated with an increase in the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. In this regard, our results support the World Health Organization’s recommendation of reducing alcohol drinking during the pandemic. Furthermore, our results show that the level of trust inside the society is associated with both the number of cases and deaths. A higher level of trust in medical personnel is associated with fewer cases, while a higher level of trust in the government is associated with fewer deaths due to COVID-19. Finally, hospital beds per thousand inhabitants are a statistically significant factor in reducing the number of deaths. Our results are robust to the estimation method, and they are of interest to governments and authorities responsible for the control of the pandemic.},

We estimate the long memory parameters before and after COVID-19 for the VIX and realized variances for several international markets. Our results show that volatility measures for most countries experienced increases in the degrees of memory following the pandemic. Moreover, several volatility measures became nonstationary, signaling the start of a period with higher and more persistent financial volatility. We show that these changes in the degrees of memory are statistically significant using a test for change in persistence.},

We analyze if periods that cover pandemics have a change in trend and persistence in growth, and in level and persistence in unemployment. We find that there is an upward trend in the persistence level of growth across centuries. In particular, shocks originated by pandemics in recent times seem to have a permanent effect on growth. Moreover, our results show that the unemployment rate increases and becomes more persistent after a pandemic. In this regard, our findings support the design and implementation of timely counter-cyclical policies to soften the shock of the pandemic.},

	abstract = {The study aims to investigate the change in the habits of Super Market consumers regarding the realization of purchases from a distance, after the announcement of the measures for the protection of the citizens from the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Specifically, the article examines the attitude of Greek Super Market consumers towards distance shopping (on line or telephone sales), before and during the pandemic. The choice of this country is important given that the Super Market online stores in Greece are under development and the appearance of COVID-19 is expected to expand the sales channels (multichannel distribution) directly affecting the profitability of the specific sector. From the processing of the questionnaires of 230 customers who were asked before and during the pandemic, it emerged that a sharp change in social living conditions can significantly affect the selected consumer market channel.},

Is your work affected by the corona crisis ? Are precautionary measures taken at the workplace? Do you have to work from home? Has your workload increased/decreased?
Have you lost your job/work/assignments?
The survey contains questions about the home situation of respondents as well as about the possible manifestation of the corona disease in members of the household. Also the effect of having a pet in the house in corona-crisis times is included.},
