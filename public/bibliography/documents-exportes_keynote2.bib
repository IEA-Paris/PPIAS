	abstract = {To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on small businesses, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses between March 28 and April 4, 2020. Several themes emerged. First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred—just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than \$10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility. Using experimental variation, we also assess take-up rates and business resilience effects for loans relative to grants-based programs.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how job creation and destruction behavior varies by employer size in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1972 to 1988. The paper also evaluates the empirical basis for conventional claims about the job-creating prowess of small businesses. The chief findings and conclusions fall into five categories:(1)Conventional wisdom about the job-creating prowess of small businesses rests on misleading interpretations of the data.(2)Many previous studies of the job creation process rely upon data that are not suitable for drawing inferences about the relationship between employer size and job creation.(3)Large plants and firms account for most newly-created and newly-destroyed manufacturing jobs.(4)Survival rates for new and existing manufacturing jobs increase sharply with employer size.(5)Smaller manufacturing firms and plants exhibit sharply higher gross rates of job creation but not higher net rates.},

	abstract = {Using unique City of Oakland data during COVID-19, we document that small business survival capabilities vary by firm size as a function of revenue resiliency, labor flexibility, and committed costs. Nonemployer businesses rely on low cost structures to survive 73\% declines in own-store foot traffic. Microbusinesses (1-to-5 employees) depend on 14\% greater revenue resiliency. Enterprises (6-to-50 employees) have twice-as-much labor flexibility, but face 11\%-to-22\% higher residual closure risk from committed costs. Finally, inconsistent with the spirit of Chetty-Friedman-Hendren-Sterner (2020) and Granja-Makridis-Yannelis-Zwick (2020), PPP application success increased medium-run survival probability by 20.5\%, but only for microbusinesses, arguing for size-targeting of policies.},

	abstract = {Social‐distancing restrictions and health‐ and economic‐driven demand shifts from COVID‐19 are expected to shutter many small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures, but there is very little early evidence on impacts. This paper provides the first analysis of impacts of the pandemic on the number of active small businesses in the United States using nationally representative data from the April 2020 Current Population Survey—the first month fully capturing early effects. The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22\% over the crucial 2‐month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African‐American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41\% drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32\%, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26\%. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36\%. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25\% drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low—down by 15\% and 8\%, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries. These findings of early‐stage losses to small business activity have important implications for policy, income losses, and future economic inequality.},

	abstract = {This note provides new evidence on how small business owners have been impacted by COVID-19, and how these eﬀects have evolved since the passage of the CARES Act. As part of a broader and ongoing project, we collected survey data from more than 8,000 small business owners in the U.S. from March 28th, one day after the CARES Act was passed, through April 20th. The data include information on ﬁrm size, layoﬀs, beliefs about the future prospects of their businesses, as well as awareness of existing government relief programs. We provide three main ﬁndings. First, by the time the CARES Act was passed, surveyed small business owners were already severely impacted by COVID-19-related disruptions: 60\% had already laid oﬀ at least one worker. Second, business owners’ expectations about the future are negative and have deteriorated throughout our study period, with 37\% of respondents in the ﬁrst week reporting that they did not expect to recover within 2 years, growing to 46\% by the last week. Third, the smallest businesses had the least awareness of government assistance programs, the slowest growth in awareness after the passage of the CARES Act, and never caught up with larger businesses. The last ﬁnding indicates that small businesses may have missed out on initial Paycheck Protection Program funds because of low baseline awareness and diﬀerential access to information relative to larger ﬁrms.},

	abstract = {We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report daily statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, employment rates, and other key indicators disaggregated by ZIP code, industry, income group, and business size. Using these data, we study how COVID-19 aﬀected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts. We ﬁrst show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in mid-March 2020, particularly in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infection and in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in aﬄuent ZIP codes. These businesses laid oﬀ many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses especially among low-wage workers in aﬄuent areas. High-wage workers experienced a “V-shaped” recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger job losses that persisted for several months. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we estimate the causal eﬀects of policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19. State-ordered reopenings of economies had small impacts on spending and employment. Stimulus payments to low-income households increased consumer spending sharply, but little of this increased spending ﬂowed to businesses most aﬀected by the COVID-19 shock, dampening its impacts on employment. Paycheck Protection Program loans increased employment at small businesses by only 2\%, implying a cost of \$377,000 per job saved. These results suggest that traditional macroeconomic tools – stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to businesses – have diminished capacity to restore employment when consumer spending is constrained by health concerns. During a pandemic, it may be more fruitful to mitigate economic hardship through social insurance. More broadly, this analysis shows how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and policy analyses without compromising privacy, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.},
