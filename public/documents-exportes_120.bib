	abstract = {Given that “Open Science” is becoming a popular policy object around the world, this study sought to identify key narratives about Open Science in policy, and critically examine the extent to which they are sustaining or strengthening multi-layered domination and inequality schemes that pre-exist in scientific knowledge production. To do so, we conducted a content analysis of Open Science policies stemming from Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and Africa to understand which narratives about Open Science policies are produced, reproduced and by whom; and in turn, whose interests may be neglected in this process. We found that Open Science policies, mostly stemming from Europe, frame “openness” as a vehicle to promote technological change as part of an inevitable and necessary cultural shift to modernity in scientific production. The global reach of these narratives, and the technologies, standards and models these narratives sustain, are dictating modes of working and collaborating among those who can access them, and creating new categories of exclusion that invalidate knowledge that cannot meet this criteria, putting historically marginalized researchers and publics at further disadvantage.},

	abstract = {A new data source providing the citation links of book publications, the Book Citation Index (BKCI), was recently released. A deeper understanding of the citation characteristics of book publications is needed before specific bibliometric indicators can be developed. In this study, the characteristics of citation distribution concentration in journal and book literature in Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), and the differences of these characteristics across fields, levels of aggregation and citation periods were probed to determine possible applications of this new data source for bibliometric studies. Even though the aggregation scheme is not sound for evaluation practices in books, aggregation matters much more for edited books in the sciences than for those in the social sciences and humanities. Journal articles have the least concentrated citation distribution in the sciences, while books play a more important role than other document types in the humanities. In the social sciences, both edited books and authored books have citation concentration distribution similar to journal articles. In addition, the Leimkuhler curves showed that citation window length (3 years vs. 9 years) does not affect the citation concentrations of most document types in journal and book literature significantly.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution in terms of shares of scholarly book publications in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in five European countries, i.e. Flanders (Belgium), Finland, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. In addition to aggregate results for the whole of the social sciences and the humanities, the authors focus on two well-established fields, namely, economics \& business and history. Design/methodology/approach Comprehensive coverage databases of SSH scholarly output have been set up in Flanders (VABB-SHW), Finland (VIRTA), Norway (NSI), Poland (PBN) and Slovenia (COBISS). These systems allow to trace the shares of monographs and book chapters among the total volume of scholarly publications in each of these countries. Findings As expected, the shares of scholarly monographs and book chapters in the humanities and in the social sciences differ considerably between fields of science and between the five countries studied. In economics \& business and in history, the results show similar field-based variations as well as country variations. Most year-to-year and overall variation is rather limited. The data presented illustrate that book publishing is not disappearing from an SSH. Research limitations/implications The results presented in this paper illustrate that the polish scholarly evaluation system has influenced scholarly publication patterns considerably, while in the other countries the variations are manifested only slightly. The authors conclude that generalizations like “performance-based research funding systems (PRFS) are bad for book publishing” are flawed. Research evaluation systems need to take book publishing fully into account because of the crucial epistemic and social roles it serves in an SSH. Originality/value The authors present data on monographs and book chapters from five comprehensive coverage databases in Europe and analyze the data in view of the debates regarding the perceived detrimental effects of research evaluation systems on scholarly book publishing. The authors show that there is little reason to suspect a dramatic decline of scholarly book publishing in an SSH.},

Although the best way of assessing the monographs would involve its individualized reading, this method is practically unfeasible both in terms of cost and time. An indicator which could be used is the prestige of the publisher of monographs and it is essential to take into account the academy’s opinion to determine it. This article reports a survey launched to 11,647 lecturers and Spanish researchers, with a response rate of 26\%, in which the respondents were asked to point those quality indicators they consider the most relevant for books as well as their opinion on the quality of publishers. As the main results, there are reported the top-rated publishers, as well as the characteristics which, according to the respondents’ opinion, determine their quality; among these characteristics, stands out the fact of counting with an assessment system with external reviewers. Regarding the list of publishers, it is also explained the indicator which allows its ranking. It is also defended the use of the results in the form of categorization.},

	abstract = {This article offers important background information about a new product, the Book Citation Index (BKCI), launched in 2011 by Thomson Reuters. Information is illustrated by some new facts concerning The BKCI's use in bibliometrics, coverage analysis, and a series of idiosyncrasies worthy of further discussion. The BKCI was launched primarily to assist researchers identify useful and relevant research that was previously invisible to them, owing to the lack of significant book content in citation indexes such as the Web of Science. So far, the content of 33,000 books has been added to the desktops of the global research community, the majority in the arts, humanities, and social sciences fields. Initial analyses of the data from The BKCI have indicated that The BKCI, in its current version, should not be used for bibliometric or evaluative purposes. The most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index. However, The BKCI is a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications.},

	abstract = {In this work, the authors propose a definition of book publishers’ specialization-multidisciplinarity and apply the operative definition to a set of 1952 Spanish publishers in 16 fields of the Social Sciences and the Humanities. The definition of specialization-multidisciplinarity is made operative with an entropy-based indicator. The indicator was applied to a set of Spanish scholarly publishers. It was hypothesized that University Presses (UPs hereafter) were significantly more multidisciplinary (or less specialized) than the rest of the publishers according to the values of the indicator. Chi square tests show that the proportion of UPs among the most multidisciplinary publishers is significantly greater than randomly expected. For the settings of this study the hypothesis is confirmed with a p value {\textless} 0.01. At the level of discipline, the concentration of titles was studied using Gini Coefficient, finding differences between disciplines within the range of 0.5. The specific features of university presses are discussed as possible explanations for the observed differences in thematic specialization.},
