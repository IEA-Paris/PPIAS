	abstract = {The current research examines the policy impacts of the AHCS project beyond the demonstration project period. Part of a larger study about the sustainability of the services and their long-term impacts, the current report examines AHCS’s wider impact on homelessness policy in Canada. The study describes how efforts to achieve sustainability in a limited sense – that is, to attain transitional funding and secure a “safe landing” for the project beyond the official end of the project – were integrally related to the project’s longer-term impact on national homelessness policy and resource allocation. It highlights the importance of the evidence presented by AHCS leaders and its timing, given that it occurred during a time when the federal government was reconsidering the direction of HPS. It also highlights the importance of the strong relationships between the research team and the policymakers and the ability of the researchers to present interim findings in a way that is most relevant to the decision-making context. This research builds on previous research on the conception (Macnaughton, Nelson, \& Goering, 2013), planning (Nelson et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2015) and implementation (Macnaughton et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2014) of AHSC. This report, together with a companion report on sustainability of programs at each of the sites (Nelson et al., 2016) offers systematic evidence about knowledge translation and provides both practical and theoretical insights as to how research makes its way into policy.},

	abstract = {Abstract While some argue that market forces are imperative to stimulate the increased supply of critical products and services to address the COVID-19 crisis, others contend that dealing with the pandemic requires coordination and rapid adjustments in supply that may be constrained by a host of factors. Although discussions have centered on policies to promote financial liquidity, we examine whether the state apparatus-not only state-owned enterprises but also development agencies and investment funds-can innovate and adjust production processes to improve infrastructure and capabilities to prevent and treat the disease. Potential actions include public-private effort addressing both discovery and coordination problems-such as a collaborative effort to develop prevention and treatment technologies, as well as state capital to stimulate retooling and expansion of strategic infrastructure. The state apparatus can also help access remote and critical areas with relatively lower private returns. In contrast, support to industries must be implemented with caution, especially for sectors whose demand may suffer permanently due to lifestyle changes. Exit strategies must be carefully crafted to avoid the risk of perpetuating unjustified and ineffective state support, establishing milestones and termination clauses based on clear performance indicators. We argue that, although using the state apparatus as a countermeasure entails a set of risks, not using it may increase the risk of extending the crisis and end with an overloaded state sector (e.g., due to massive bailouts), challenging the implementation of subsequent adjustments.},

	url = {https://www.brookings.edu/research/building-on-recent-advances-in-evidence-based-policymaking/},
	abstract = {The current fiscal environment makes it imperative that we produce more value with each dollar that government spends. Doing so will require better use of evidence in policymaking. The good news is that over the past decade new government strategies have begun to emerge—at the federal, state, and local levels—that simultaneously offer the potential to make better use of taxpayer dollars and speed up progress in addressing serious social problems. These strategies: subsidize learning and experimentation so that new solutions are developed, increase the amount of evidence on the effectiveness of existing and potential new programs, make greater use of evidence in budget and management decisions, make purposeful efforts to target improved outcomes for particular populations, and spur innovation and align incentives through cross-sector and community-based collaborations.

This paper describes the new strategies. It also proposes several steps to advance the use of evidence-based policy in the federal government, including giving agencies the authority to reserve a percentage of program spending to fund program evaluations and expanding the use of tiered evidence standards in grant competitions. Finally, it recommends two initiatives that would supplement the diffusion of these evidence-based practices with a more-focused approach that aims to supply solutions for specific high-priority social problems. The Ten-Year Challenge would tackle ten social problems by establishing data-driven, outcome-focused initiatives in one hundred communities. A federal Pay for Success initiative would help state and local governments establish Pay for Success projects in areas like early-childhood education where state and local activity has the potential to achieve important federal policy objectives or produce significant federal budget savings.},

This paper presents a framework that categorizes applications from behavioral economics along three stages of the crisis management life cycle – crisis preparation, crisis action, and postcrisis.
