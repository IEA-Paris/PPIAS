Physical and virtual reality exist side by side but also increasingly merge. This symposium addresses central notions like subjective experience and presence in real and in virtual worlds. Participants are world experts in this new and burgeoning fields. They will discuss how the potential of virtual worlds is currently harnessed by neuroscientists, for basic research and for societal applications, as well as for clinical use. Expected innovations and future perspectives of subjective experience will be discussed in the light of increasing virtualization of our social interactions.

This online symposium is organized by Beatrice de Gelder, Maastricht University, Paris Institute for Advanced Study Fellow, and Julie Grezes, ENS Paris, with the support of the Paris IAS.
