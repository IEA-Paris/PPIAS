The Paris Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) leads several innovative projects focused on collective intelligence, aiming to explore how groups of individuals or systems can collaborate to solve complex problems. These projects often involve interdisciplinary research, drawing from fields like cognitive science, social sciences, and artificial intelligence. By bringing together scholars from diverse backgrounds, the institute examines how knowledge, creativity, and decision-making processes are enhanced through collaboration.
