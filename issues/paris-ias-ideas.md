The Paris IAS Ideas program features short presentations and papers that discuss the "definitive" version of an idea or concept that outstanding researchers and practitioners have been working on for years but haven't had the opportunity to formalize in a clear, widely accessible publication.

The authors include influential researchers across the social sciences and humanities and practitioners across sectors of activity that have been invited to the Paris IAS for a one-month writing residency to formalize ideas that have the potential to become influential pieces beyond their own discipline and sector.
