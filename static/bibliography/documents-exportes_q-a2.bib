	abstract = {It has taken decades of awareness through various means, to teach people about the environmental implications of their actions and convince them to take measures internationally, nationally and personally towards its protection. But the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic- described by UNFPA as the fastest moving global crisis in a century-has been causing unprecedented health and socioeconomic challenges. Whilst the virus takes over the world, countries have been trying to adapt to the post-Corona world and boost their fallen economies and lift social systems. With so much to be convalesced, our environment finds itself entirely removed from the list of injured. There are many who believe that the environment actually got an opportunity to recuperate from years of damage, due to lesser human interference during COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. This article seeks to prove this belief only illusionary and picks out some tremendously important issues that are misunderstood as fortunate, underestimated as unimportant, and most of all, left unnoticed. These environmental concerns affecting land, water, air and all of life, are of colossal gravity and must be tackled against the clock. Acknowledging that environment is the last thing that governments have on their minds now, this piece strives to draw attention to the maleficent impact of the ‘new normal’ on Earth, through statistics from various countries across the world. It brings to notice the direct and many indirect effects the advent of COVID-19 has brought and will bring to our environment. Addressing numerous serious problems ranging from an increase in carbon print to overpopulation, it offers plausible solutions to ensure that all is not lost in the blink of an eye. There are many exploiting the world’s changed focus and operate full freedom to perpetrate illegalities. With the coming years stripping every last resource on our planet to recoup losses that the virus has caused, our environment must be protected before it reaches the point of destruction we predicted much later in time. Thus, this research attempts to give clarity to many things that that our distracted vision is masked by.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the nature of our social interactions. In order to understand how protective equipment and distancing measures influence the ability to comprehend others’ emotions and, thus, to effectively interact with others, we carried out an online study across the Italian population during the first pandemic peak. Participants were shown static facial expressions (Angry, Happy and Neutral) covered by a sanitary mask or by a scarf. They were asked to evaluate the expressed emotions as well as to assess the degree to which one would adopt physical and social distancing measures for each stimulus. Results demonstrate that, despite the covering of the lower-face, participants correctly recognized the facial expressions of emotions with a polarizing effect on emotional valence ratings found in females. Noticeably, while females’ ratings for physical and social distancing were driven by the emotional content of the stimuli, males were influenced by the “covered” condition. The results also show the impact of the pandemic on anxiety and fear experienced by participants. Taken together, our results offer novel insights on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social interactions, providing a deeper understanding of the way people react to different kinds of protective face covering.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates the epistemological and communicative competences the experts need to use and communicate evidence in the reasoning process leading to diagnosis. The diagnosis and diagnosis communication are presented as intertwined processes that should be jointly addressed in medical consultations, to empower patients’ compliance in illness management. The paper presents defeasible reasoning as specific to the diagnostic praxis, showing how this type of reasoning threatens effective diagnosis communication and entails that we should understand diagnostic evidence as defeasible as well. It argues that metaphors might be effective communicative devices to let the patients understand the relevant defeasors in the diagnostic reasoning process, helping to improve effective diagnosis communication, and also encouraging a change in patients’ beliefs and attitudes on their own experience of illness and illness’ management.},

In collaboration with Facebook, and with input from researchers at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), we fielded a global survey on these topics.

A sample of Facebook users were invited to respond to the survey. Based on input from our team, Facebook provides weights to reduce bias due to nonresponse and to target each country's adult or Internet-using population, rather than just Facebook users. Aggregated statistics are available via our dashboards, JHU's dashbaords, and our public API. Microdata is available for researchers via data use agreements with Facebook and MIT.},

	abstract = {Humans typically create and maintain social bonds through interactions that occur at close social distances. The interpersonal distance of at least 1 m recommended as a relevant measure for COVID-19 contagion containment requires a significant change in everyday behavior. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective masks and gloves and whose COVID-19 test results were positive, negative, or unknown. Information concerning dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes, and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts, and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A Bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards individuals wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to COVID-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were maintained towards confederates wearing protective gear, even when their COVID-19 test result was unknown or positive. This protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of perceived vulnerability to infection; this perception must be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective health-safety measures.},
