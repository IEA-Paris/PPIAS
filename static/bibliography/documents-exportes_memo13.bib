	abstract = {Central to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic strategy, COVID-19 vaccination depends on the population’s uptake decisions. Because at least 60\% of the population needs to be vaccinated, but fewer, for example, in Germany are expected to do so, it is important to know how to convince those who are undecided or skeptical. According to the health care standard of enabling citizens to make informed decisions based on balanced information (boosting) – instead of persuasion or seduction (nudging) – a comparison of benefits and harms of having or not having the vaccination would be required to inform these groups. With the help of a representative survey, we investigated the contribution of fact boxes, an established intervention format for informed intentions. Study 1 shows the development of knowledge and evaluation of COVID-19 vaccinations by German citizens between Nov 2020 and Feb 2021. Study 2 reveals objective information needs and subjective information requirements of those laypeople at the end of Nov. Study 3 shows that the fact box format is effective for risk communication about COVID-19. Based on these insights, a fact box on the efficacy and safety of mRNA-vaccines was implemented with the help of a national health authority. Study 4 shows that fact boxes increase vaccination knowledge and positive evaluations of the benefit-harm ratio of vaccination in skeptics and undecideds. Our results demonstrate that simple fact boxes can be an effective boost of informed decision making among undecided and skeptical people, and that informed decisions can lead to more positive vaccination evaluations of the public.},

	abstract = {This online experiment used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine the impact of exposure to conspiracy social media messages on Chinese young adults’ perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Three major findings were identified. First, exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories resulted in less favorable attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, less positive perceived norms regarding getting vaccinated, and weaker vaccination intentions. Second, people who were more knowledgeable about the HPV vaccine had more favorable attitudes, more positive norms, higher perceived behavioral control, and greater behavioral intentions. Finally, vaccine knowledge moderated the effect of exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Our results suggest that, among Chinese young adult social media users, preexisting knowledge of the HPV vaccine may have a protective effect against exposure to online conspiracy theories.},
