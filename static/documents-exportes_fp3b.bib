	doi = {10.2196/26498},
	abstract = {Background: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever-increasing mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap.
Objective: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT \&amp; More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness.
Methods: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n=200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT \&amp; More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group (n=200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy.
Results: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1,222=3.98; P=.047; d=0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F1,220=8.79; P=.003; d=0.40) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8\%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet- and mobile-based interventions (r=0.260; P=.004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r=0.236; P=.009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used.
Conclusions: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT \&amp; More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold intervention to enhance students’ health.

	abstract = {Background Metacognitive therapy (MCT) continues to gain increased ground as a treatment for psychological complaints. During the last years, several clinical trials on the efficacy of MCT have been published. The aim of the current study was to provide an updated meta-analytic review of the effect of MCT for psychological complaints. Methods We conducted a systematic search of trials on MCT for young and adult patients with psychological complaints published until January 2018, using PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Trials with a minimum of 10 participants in the MCT condition were included. Results A total of 25 studies that examined a variety of psychological complaints met our inclusion criteria, of which 15 were randomized controlled trials. We identified only one trial that was conducted with children and adolescents. In trials with adult patients, large uncontrolled effect size estimates from pre- to posttreatment and follow-up suggest that MCT is effective at reducing symptoms of the targeted primary complaint, anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional metacognitions. The comparison with waitlist control conditions also resulted in a large effect (Hedges’ g = 2.06). The comparison of MCT to cognitive and behavioral interventions at posttreatment and at follow-up showed pooled effect sizes (Hedges’ g) of 0.69 and 0.37 at posttreatment (k = 8) and follow-up (k = 7), respectively. Conclusions Our findings indicate that MCT is an effective treatment for a range of psychological complaints. To date, strongest evidence exists for anxiety and depression. Current results suggest that MCT may be superior to other psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral interventions. However, more trials with larger number of participants are needed in order to draw firm conclusions.},

	abstract = {Background: PTSD Coach Australia is an app for serving and ex-serving defense members and was adapted for the Australian context in 2013 from PTSD Coach, which was created in the United States.
Objective: This study aimed to provide a user-centered evaluation of the app from the perspective of serving and ex-serving members of the Australian Defence Force.
Methods: Qualitative data were collected in response to questions to participants in 1 of 5 workshops (n=29) or in telephone interviews (n=24). Quantitative data were collected using the user version of Mobile Apps Rating Scale (uMARS).
Results: Analysis of the qualitative data demonstrated mixed support for the app. While some people found it extremely useful, especially as an adjunct to therapy, others pointed out limitations and cautioned against the app potentially triggering symptoms in people with PTSD. This perceived risk was usually found to stem from frustration with the app’s functionality rather than its content. Participants spoke about the helpful and unhelpful aspects of the app and barriers to its use and made suggestions for improvement. Many participants encouraged its continued use and highlighted the need for it to be promoted more broadly, as many were not aware of it until they were invited to participate in this research.
Conclusions: PTSD Coach Australia was seen in a positive light by some participants, but others thought it had too much text and the potential to trigger a traumatic response in users with PTSD. A need to update the app was also a common comment as was the need to increase awareness of the app’s existence.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, and it was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.
Objective: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students’ awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps.
Methods: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants’ awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists.
Results: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6\%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status.
Conclusions: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.},

	abstract = {Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an impact on several aspects of life, including university students’ mental health. Mobile mental care applications (apps) comprise a form of online mental care that enables the delivery of remote mental care.
Objectives
This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students in Spain and to explore their attitudes toward the use of mobile mental care apps.
Method
Respondents answered a survey, which comprised two sections. The first included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) that was employed to assess the students’ mental health. The second section included six questions developed by the authors to explore the students’ attitudes toward mental care apps.
Results
The results showed that the students suffered from anxiety and depression as well as social dysfunction. Further, 91.3 \% of the students had never used a mobile app for mental health, 36.3 \% were unaware of such apps, and 79.2 \% were willing to use them in the future.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the psychological health of university students. Mobile mental care apps may be an effective and efficient way to access mental care, particularly during a pandemic.},
