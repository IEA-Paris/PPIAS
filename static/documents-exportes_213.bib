	abstract = {This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive view of the role of language in academic publishing in social sciences. It also advocates the balanced multilingualism as an approach that supports taking language into account in all aspects of research assessment without prioritizing scholarly communication in any language over publications in other languages. To do this, we elaborate a geopolitical perspective on academic publishing that highlights the role of language in science and the benefits of multilingualism to society. Then, we provide new insights into multilingual publishing in the social sciences using bibliographical data from national current research information systems. Finally, we present the concept of balanced multilingualism in light of various policy initiatives, among others the Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism in Scholarly Communication, to provide recommendations on how multilingualism can be taken into account at all stages and across different types of qualitative and quantitative research assessment procedures.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the diversity of users of open access articles on the Finnish Journal.fi platform. This platform hosts around hundred open access journals from Finland publishing in different fields and mainly Finnish and English languages. The study is based on an online survey, conducted on 48 journals during Spring 2020, in which visitors were asked to indicate their background and allow their location and download behaviour be tracked. Among 668 survey participants, the two largest groups were students (40\%) and researchers (36\%), followed by private citizens (8\%), other experts (7\%) and teachers (5\%). Other identified user categories include journalists, civil servants, entrepreneurs and politicians. While new publications attract a considerable share of the views, there is still a relatively large interest, especially among students, in older materials. Our findings indicate that Finnish language publications are particularly important for reaching students, citizens, experts and politicians. Thus, open access to publications in national languages is vital for the local relevance and outreach of research.},
