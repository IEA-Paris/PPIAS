	abstract = {The integration of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) in Horizon 2020 is an important feature of the programme. To monitor the development of this cross-cutting issue is an EU commitment. Various dimensions are examined, such as the budget going to SSH partners (overall and in each part of the programme), qualitative aspects, performance of disciplines and sectors involved, as well as which countries are represented as participants and coordinators. The scope of this monitoring report on the integration of SSH across Horizon 2020 has gradually been extended to cover the European Research Council, Future Emerging Technologies, Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions and Research Infrastructures. This year we also look at the topical Science with and for Society (SwafS) part of the programme. This fifth edition of the report shows that substantial quantitative progress has been made in many areas since the start of the programme. However, it also illustrates that more effort is needed to improve the quality of SSH integration. The quantitative data presented here indicate how well the policy of SSH integration is put into practice. However, this by no means tells the full story of SSH integration in the overall framework programme.},

Es behandelt das Thema in drei Raten. Zunächst werden die jüngsten Trends bei der Forschungsförderung erörtert. Zweitens wird ein kurzer historischer Überblick über die Bemühungen zur Integration von SSH in das EU-Forschungsrahmenprogramm gegeben. Anschließend werden einige Beobachtungen zu fortgesetzten Herausforderungen in SSH hinzugefügt. Abschließend werden auf der Grundlage der Konferenzdiskussionen einige Vorschläge für SSH-Wissenschaftler gemacht. Insofern ist das Working Paper auch ein Dokument zur weiteren Lektüre für diejenigen, die frühere, kürzere Texte gelesen haben, die zur Vorbereitung dieser Konferenz veröffentlicht wurden.},

	abstract = {Using the Triple Helix model of university–industry–government relations, one can measure the extent to which innovation has become systemic instead of assuming the existence of national (or regional) systems of innovations on a priori grounds. Systemness of innovation patterns, however, can be expected to remain in transition because of integrating and differentiating forces. Integration among the functions of wealth creation, knowledge production, and normative control takes place at the interfaces in organizations, while exchanges on the market, scholarly communication in knowledge production, and political discourse tend to differentiate globally. The neo-institutional and the neo-evolutionary versions of the Triple Helix model enable us to capture this tension reflexively. Empirical studies inform us whether more than three helices are needed for the explanation. The Triple Helix indicator can be extended algorithmically, for example, with local–global as a fourth dimension or, more generally, to an N-tuple of helices.},

	abstract = {Literature shows that, facing the neo-liberal definition of academic excellence, early career investigators (ECIs) in the social sciences and the humanities (SSH) have developed particular professional identities and behaviours towards the requirements of the academic career. Specificities of the SSH make the compliance to the assessment procedures of the “neo-liberal university” particularly challenging. Furthermore ECIs in the SSH are caught in an unprecedented “triple bind”. While pursuing their post-doctoral career in the context of the neo-liberal university, they are still academically trained in the disciplinary and collegial values of the “traditional university”. Although most career rewards and evaluation criteria are bound to the neo-liberal university, researchers now in the early stages of their career also constitute the first generation of academics to be exposed to the new requirements of the “open university”, through the Open Science policies and the Impact Agenda. In such context of uncertainty and conflicting rationalities, more efficient “early career building information ecosystems” should be put in place within academia. We also recommend to better integrate ECIs in the design and implementation of research evaluation principles and processes.},
