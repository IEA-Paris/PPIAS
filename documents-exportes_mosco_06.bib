	abstract = {This research is concerned with indirect minority influence, the change of attitudes that are related, but not identical, to the issue under persuasive attack. A message on one of two linked attitudes was developed and attributed to in-group minority or majority sources. Analysis of source and pretest timing (immediate vs. 2 weeks before treatment), thought to affect the accessibility of the linked attitude, revealed no effect on focal beliefs. However, the linked attitudes of those exposed to the minority differed significantly from those exposed to the majority, and were congruous with the conservative thrust of the persuasive appeal. Pretest timing also affected indirect attitudes (both ps {\textless} .05). Implications of these indirect attitude results for minority and majority influence were drawn.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces the common ingroup identity model as a means of reducing intergroup bias. This model proposes that bias can be reduced by factors that transform members' perceptions of group boundaries from “us” and “them” to a more inclusive “we”. From this perspective, several features specified by the contact hypothesis (e.g. co-operative interaction) facilitate more harmonious intergroup interactions, at least in part, because they contribute to the development of a common ingroup identity. In this chapter, we describe laboratory and field studies that are supportive of the model; we also relate the model to earlier work on aversive racism.},

Two studies examined the prediction derived from uncertainty–identity theory (Hogg, 2007) that this relationship between leader prototypicality and support weakens when group members have elevated self-related uncertainty, due to increased support for non-prototypical leaders. Student participants indicated their level of uncertainty and their support for a prospective student leader who was prototypical or non-prototypical of students at their university–prototypicality was a between-subjects variable in Study 1 (N=98), and a within-subjects variable in Study 2 (N=132). As predicted, participants supported the prototypical leader more strongly than the non-prototypical leader, but this effect was significantly weakened (Study 2) or disappeared (Study 1) under uncertainty, due to a significant increase in support for the non-prototypical leader. Implications for empowerment of non-prototypical leaders are discussed.},

Using responses from samples of women and ethnic minority groups, four studies demonstrate the utility of this conceptualization of ingroup identification and provide support for the IIS. Results from these studies establish construct validity, concurrent and discriminant validity, and high degrees of test-retest reliability for the IIS. Reaction time evidence also is provided, supporting the use of the IIS as a measure of ingroup identification. Particular strengths of this conceptualization of ingroup identification and potential uses for the IIS are discussed.},
