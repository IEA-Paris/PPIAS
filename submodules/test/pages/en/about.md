The [**Proceedings of the French Institutes for Advanced Studies**](https://France.PIAS.science "PFIAS") (PFIAS) is a platform to promote and showcase the outstanding work produced by the fellows of the Institutes for Advanced Studies in France. Each of these institutes is a research center that welcomes researchers from all over the world in the various fields. It has been created by the [**French Network of Institutes for Advanced Studies**](http://rfiea "RFIEA") (RFIEA). 

The research projects carried out at the Institutes, beyond their international aspect, are characterized by an interdisciplinary approach (bringing together science, politics, economy, and society) and the development of new methodologies and perspectives. To meet the challenges of our time and those to come, it encourages collaboration between research, administration, the economic world and citizens.

Each year, the Institutes' research fellows and partner institutions organize many scientific events on its premises, on fundamental research or in response to major societal problems.

These proceedings present the conferences, lecture series and other scientific productions of the french Institutes for Advanced Studies in the form of indexed and quotable publications, often accompanied by videos or podcasts.
