Dream Appreciation session will be conducted following the group technique described by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Montague Ullman (1996, Appreciating Dreams: a Group Approach, Sage books). The stages of the technique are: recall and clarification of the dream; groups members’ projections about the dream; dreamer describes their recent waking life; dream is read back; connections between dream and dreamer’s waking life are suggested by the group. The Gains from Dream Interpretation questionnaire will be completed. As a separate activity, during the session, artist Dr Julia Lockheart will create a painting of the dream onto a page taken (with publisher’s permission) from Freud’s book The Interpretation of Dreams, incorporating into the artwork the  
text format and keywords. A gallery of these artworks, and rationale for this art science collaboration, including hypothesized empathy changes, can be seen at [http://DreamsID.com.](http://DreamsID.com. "http://DreamsID.com.") An enlarged print of the artwork is sent to the dreamer after the event and can be used to revisit the dream with friends and family.
