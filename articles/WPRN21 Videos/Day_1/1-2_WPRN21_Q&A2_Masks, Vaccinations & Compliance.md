Face Masks are probably the most iconic visual representation of the Covid-19 Pandemic. While the world was physically distancing, masks made this distance visible and provided a constant reminder of the new rules we were subject to. Masks, and arguably even more so the vaccine, also are objects of contestation and led to inequalities and resistance in some parts of society. In this session, we heard why people wore masks and got vaccinated (or not) in various communities around the globe, how this affected social interactions, and how education and social trust affected compliance with regulations. We also looked at the pragmatics of what ‘wearing masks’ entails, and what the ‘right’ distance to others is in various contexts. More abstractly, we discussed how language, metaphors, and humour can foster hope or defeatism, and even enable or limit unsafe behaviours. Finally, we looked at how the environment was affected by the new rules and regulations that came into effect around the globe. As how we relate to each other was deeply altered by restrictions and regulations during the Pandemic, the small cracks and cleavages in society became more visible and pronounced. These initial findings and discussions about rules and compliance we have had must be continued if we want to avoid that restrictions for the benefit of our society drive us apart as a community.

The Q&A session on the theme "Masks, Vaccinations and Compliance" during WPRN21 conference in Paris on December 9th 2021 is based on 6 projects registered in the WPRN database.

### 1. [You See Me, You See Me Not–Masked Effects on An Environment Tangled in COVID-19](https://wprn.org/item/512752)

It has taken decades of awareness to teach people about the environmental implications of their actions and convince them to protect it.But the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic-described by UNFPA as the fastest moving global crisis in a century-has been causing unprecedented health and socioeconomic challenges. With so much to be convalesced, our environment finds itself entirely removed from the list of injured.There are many who believe that the environment instead got an opportunity to recuperate from years of damage, due to lesser human interference during lockdowns and restrictions. This article seeks to prove this belief illusionary and picks out some tremendously important issues that are misunderstood as fortunate, underestimated as unimportant, and most of all, left unnoticed.Disposable masks that are non-biodegradable were previously in 2019,a $ 800 million business but now a $166 billion market. Talking about family planning in the pandemic, a report by MSI states that in South Africa, perceived availability of abortion services from a clinic among women was only 43% during the pandemic compared to 76% before the pandemic, while it decreased from 61% to 44% in India. Therefore his piece strives to draw attention to the maleficent impact of the ‘new normal’ on Earth. Addressing numerous serious problems including an increase in carbon print to overpopulation, it offers plausible solutions to ensure that all is not lost in the blink of an eye.It uses doctrinal and non-doctrinal research from reports,surveys and articles from Marie Stopes International,ABC News,BBC News,newspapers,etc.to point this out. With the coming years stripping every last resource on our planet to recoup losses that the virus has caused,our environment must be protected before it reaches the point of destruction we predicted much later in time.Thus, this research attempts to give clarity to many things that that our distracted vision is masked by.

### 2. [The consequences of COVID‑19 on social interactions: An online study on face covering](https://wprn.org/item/544052)

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the nature of our social interactions. In order to understand how protective equipment and distancing measures influence ability to comprehend others’ emotions and, thus, to effectively interact with each other, we carried out an online survey across the Italian population (N = 96) during the pandemic peak. Participants were shown static facial expressions covered by a sanitary mask or by a scarf. They were asked to evaluate the expressed emotions as well as to assess the degree to which one would adopt physical and social distancing measures for each stimulus. Results demonstrate a polarizing effect on emotional ratings found in female participants. Noticeably, while females’ ratings for physical and social distancing were driven by the emotional content of the stimuli, males were influenced by the “covered” condition. Taken together, our results shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social cognition.

### 3. [Metaphors for vaccination and defeasible reasoning](https://wprn.org/item/439252)

Metaphor can be a useful device to grasp an unknown concept by using a known concept (@Lakoff-Johnson_1980) (@Bowdle-Gentner_2005), thus explaining a phenomenon, illness, which otherwise might remain unintelligible to patients. However, metaphor also frames the experience of illness, providing a specific perspective to interpret both the disease and its development (@Hauser-Schwartz_2015) (@Semino et al. 2018). Exposure to metaphorical framing may modify how people reason about a specific problem (@Thibodeau-Borodisky_2011), also in the case of metaphors used for vaccination (@Scherer et al._2014). However, no empirical study on the effects of metaphor for vaccination in defeasible conditions was conducted and it would be important in the current COVID-19 outbreak. Background : The first assumption is that a metaphor can be explicitly meant to better understand an argument (@Steen_2010). The second assumption is that diagnostic reasoning in the case of vaccination is a non-monotonic process (@salis_evidence_2021). Different from standard deductive reasoning, certain premises may indeed be rebutting defeasors, liable to make the conclusion a bad one, or undercutting defeasors, liable to make the other premises bad (to draw certain conclusions).

### 4. [Disparagement Humor Permits Unsafe COVID-19 Behaviors](https://wprn.org/item/546152)

Past research shows that disparagement humor (i.e. humor that denigrates or belittles its target) signals that prejudice against various social groups (particularly groups for whom negative attitudes towards are socially suppressed, e.g. women, gays, Muslims) is acceptable in the given social context (@Ford & Olah_2021). Based on this work, we hypothesized that disparagement humor diminishing the severity of COVID-19 would promote tolerance of unsafe pandemic behaviors. Throughout late March through late April 2021, we surveyed several Reddit communities via randomized experimental design (n = 106). After reporting their perceived threat of COVID-19 & demographic information, participants read a series of vignettes describing a group of friends in a church setting, and viewed either memes belittling COVID-19 (e.g. highlighting high survival rates) or memes unrelated to COVID-19. After the meme manipulation, participants read a vignette describing a woman confronting an usher about a few church members not following protocol (i.e. not wearing masks), with the usher expressing nonconcern over the matter. Participants then reported the extent to which they believed the woman and the usher each handled the situation in an appropriate manner (i.e. personal tolerance), as well as their views that their friends exchanging the memes believed (i.e. perceived local norm of tolerance). Results from a moderated mediation model confirmed our hypothesis: participants who saw the pandemic-disparagement memes perceived a greater local norm of tolerance for unsafe behaviors. For participants who view COVID-19 as a low threat, that local norm resulted in greater personal tolerance of the unsafe behavior. For participants who view COVID-19 as a high threat, the local norm had no impact on their personal tolerance. Community further moderated these effects, with the memes having no effect on the local norm in the skeptic subreddits.

### 5. [Role of Education, Risk Perception and Social Trust in Predicting Intent to get the Covid-19 Vaccine](https://wprn.org/item/547652)

Globally, research suggests a relatively low intended vaccination rate for the COVID-19 vaccine (@Sallam_2021) with significantly lower acceptance rates in countries with a history of vaccine mistrust (@Institute of Global Health Innovation_2021). Using survey data from Facebook users (n = 45,303) from 23 countries collected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with Facebook, we examine how education, perceptions of health risks, and trust in health authorities (including the WHO), scientists, and politicians influence future COVID-19 vaccination intentions. Our analysis found that trust in local and global health experts is a significant predictor of future intention to get immunized. Additionally, perceived community health risks were positively related to vaccine intention, but not perceived risks of personally getting infected. Intent to get vaccinated was negatively associated with trusting ordinary people, highlighting the importance of domain-specific expertise. The 23 countries studied differed particularly in terms of the impact of education on intent to get vaccinated, with more educated participants in e.g. Egypt and India being more hesitant than less educated participants from these countries whereas the reverse pattern was found for participants from Brazil, France, US and the UK. Our findings, while consistent with prior studies on predictors of COVID-vaccine acceptance, provide insight into countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and offer recommendations for developing more tailored vaccination campaigns.

### 6. [Interpersonal distance: modulation of individual and social behaviour related to the COVID 19 pandemics](https://wprn.org/item/511252)

Related to the Covid-19 outbreak, many countries all around the world have decided to impose restrictions to slow down the spreading and contain the infection, ranging from suggesting physical- distancing to imposing the lockdown of entire country. In this context, it is highly plausible that the fear of being infected, the physical distancing imposed by governments along with individual priorities, might have an influence on the distance we keep with others. To investigate this issue, we devised: 1) an online survey assessing demographics, the opinions toward quarantine, the self-reported altruism, the perceived vulnerability to disease and a self-report regarding moral attitudes; 2) an online task to test the interpersonal distance participants keep with others depending on the gender, the status of other’s infection (positive or negative to the COVID-19 test or not tested) and whether the other is wearing or not protective equipment.
