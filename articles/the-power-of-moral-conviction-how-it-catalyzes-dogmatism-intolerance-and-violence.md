abstract: "Our moral sense is a biological adaptation specific to our species.
  It has evolved to facilitate group living, regulate social interactions, and
  promote cooperation beyond kinship. Beliefs intensely associated with moral
  values can motivate positive societal progress. However, moral convictions can
  also lead to dogmatism, antagonistic attitudes, a polarized political climate,
  and violent collective actions. This article draws on theories and empirical
  evidence from anthropology, neuroscience, cognitive science, social
  psychology, economics, and political science to explain why and how
  moralization increases the strength of beliefs and attitudes –in certainty and
  importance. Moral convictions are perceived as absolute, universal, and
  definite beliefs or principles. They engage the brain circuit associated with
  reward processing and valuation, which motivates and reinforces behavior. "
