Our research focuses on brain planning and control of movement in humans and on robotics. Our studies combine theoretical and computational approaches with behavioral studies aimed at characterizing goal directed motor behavior. We have also conducted brain imaging studies aimed at unraveling the nature of brain representations of movement in action production and perception and social interactions.
Given the significant roles movement plays in different artistic fields, e.g., fine arts, dance, and music, I will apply some of the insights gained from our research on brain representations of movement, space and time, to address several fundamental questions. These include whether humans' neuroesthetic and emotional responses to form and motion result from the particular nature of such brain representations; whether different artistic modalities use movement, space and time in different ways, or whether there exist common principles, shared by various artistic modalities. This includes collaborations with artists from different artistic domains. I also wish to collaborate and develop these ideas jointly with motor neuroscientists and with mathematicians and roboticists.
