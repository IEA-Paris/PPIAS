Although France and the United States are both wealthy, Western countries, they differ quite a bit in the way they deal with food and eating. Americans are more worried about their weight and the effects of the foods they eat on their health. In spite of this, the French are thinner and somewhat healthier; specifically the French have lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Fischler and Rozin have been investigating how these differences come about for about 20 years. They have found French-American differences in behavior: for example, French meals occur at much more regular times.  They have found differences in food attitudes: forexample, the French focus on the pleasurable experience of eating foods, where Americans focus more on the health consequences of the foods they eat. There are also important differences in the food environments of the two countries. Opportunities for snacking are higher for Americans, and French serve smaller food portions. This project will summarize what is known about the French and American food worlds, from the data we have collected, and from historical, culinary, demographic and economic sources. The project will also attempt to explain the cause of the French-American differences, and what each country can learn from the other to maximize health, the pleasure of eating, and environmental sustainability.
