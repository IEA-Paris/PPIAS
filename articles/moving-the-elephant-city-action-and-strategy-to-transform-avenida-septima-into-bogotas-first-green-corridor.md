## Introduction

In the heart of Bogotá, where economic activity thrives in the shadow of the city's mountainous backdrop, one of its main vessels is soon to be collapsed. Avenidas Caracas and Séptima represent the epicenter of commuting activity in eastern Bogotá; while the first is in process of hosting the first heavy rail metro line for the city, the latter struggles in providing better infrastructure, as it is a political challenge that seems insurmountable.

The urgent need for solutions to accommodate the current and future demand in this vital area of the city became evident. However, due to its rich historical heritage, narrow sidewalks, and limited lanes, transforming Carrera Séptima into an efficient urban transit corridor presents a formidable challenge. Over the past two decades, the city has seen multiple administrations propose ambitious projects for this corridor, only to face relentless opposition from politicians,  high-income residents, heritage preservationists, and environmental advocates, among others. These opposition efforts have successfully stalled numerous projects, obstructing much-needed urban renewal. 

 

One of the most contentious proposals was brought forth by former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa in 2019, which aimed to expand the existing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network, known as TransMilenio, in a manner that faced severe resistance from a coalition of concerned citizens, local politicians, community-based organizations, and environmentalists. Their efforts, often fueled by legal action, resulted in a judicial battle that completely blocked the project. 

 

As a response to these new ways of interacting with high-scale urban projects Claudia López administration (2020 - 2023) introduced a new approach to the Séptima Corridor project, the Green Corridor (CV7), which was conceived to engage the community in a more comprehensive dialogue, prioritize environmental sustainability, and (try to) foster consensus. 

 

This paper delves into the intricacies of this urban governance and transportation challenge, exploring the conflict that has consistently arisen in the Séptima Corridor. It delves into the literature that studied and dissected some of these conflicts, recognizing them as class-based tension, the result of a lack of openness in participation, and low governmental capacity to respond to legal challenges. It particularly examines the strategies employed by the City of Bogotá -aware of these conflicts- to mitigate the risk of judicial opposition in the development of the Green Corridor.  

 

While the outcome of the Green Corridor project remains uncertain at the time of this paper's publication, the case study serves as a testament to the deliberate and comprehensive approach employed by the City of Bogotá. It underlines the importance of stakeholder engagement, effective communication, and direct negotiations as key tools to mitigate opposition and foster consensus in highly contested urban projects. It also states that this open approach allows new technical and narrative solutions to emerge in project development, and recognizes the combination of these elements as a way to gain leverage and better positioning to overcome the limitations of the previous project. 

 

In an era where urban development projects face increasing scrutiny and opposition, the Bogotá case study provides valuable insights into the complexities of governance, community engagement, and the delicate balance between public interest and stakeholder demands. Ultimately, the winner-takes-all dynamic that often characterizes these projects is challenging, but the city's commitment to building a compelling narrative and creating a more inclusive vision for urban development reflects a promising step toward a more collaborative and productive future. 

## Global structure 

This paper is organized as follows: The first part contains a brief context and discussion around the Séptima Corridor in Bogotá to situate the actions to be analyzed in the context of urban governance, transportation, and socio-legal studies. Then, it will briefly describe the 2016-2019 attempt of pursuing a project in the Corridor (TransMilenio Séptima or TM7) and the network of opposition created around it. Referencing the new approach suggested by City Government (the Green Corridor or CV7) this paper will claim how there is a different design and engagement strategy intentionally conceived to mitigate opposition and innovate in urban design and transportation planning. To bridge this argument the core section of this paper will outline three different challenges identified by the literature in the Séptima (and Bogotá) context and will reference how the Green Corridor approach was intentionally different. These challenges are class-based visions of urban projects, lack of openness in participation, and governmental capacity to articulate and process a different design and judicial strategy. For these three elements the document will provide references and particular solutions achieved or suggested by the administration. Finally the paper will reflect on how these approaches can mitigate some judicial activism (not all) and shape new ways of envisioning urban projects in the city and the region. 

## Context 

Bogotá (Colombia) concentrates most of its economic activity in the eastern border of the city, adjacent to its mountain chain. Because of this, the 100 block wide area between the mountains and Avenida Caracas (colloquially referred as the “expanded downtown”) is the most popular commuting destination in the city carrying half of its total daily trips: 6.5 million (DNP 2017). Nonetheless, the only mass transit service close to this area is the Avenida Caracas TransMilenio, the first BRT corridor of the city inaugurated in the early 2000s, which -by now- is completely out of capacity as it was projected to operate at a maximum load of 35,000 passengers per hour per direction and it is carrying 53,000 and up (DNP, 2017). 

 

With Caracas incapable of supporting all of the trips fed by the BRT network of the city, the eastern border claims for deep solutions that are capable of absorbing current and future demand. Because of the presence of most governmental institutions, the financial  

clusters, and elite shopping districts, it is plausible that this portion of the city will continue to be the major trip generator in Bogotá. Throughout the entire “expanded downtown” Carrera Séptima is a few blocks from Avenida Caracas. Although it is the perfect complement for the City’s mobility necessities, it is a challenge for every Mayor in office over the last 20 years to propose and build a project. High income neighbors, public heritage assets, historic parks, and buildings integrate this Avenue in the heart of the city. Its complexity, narrow sidewalks and limited lanes imply that finding the best practical solution to urban transit is very complex.  

 

In recent times, the last five governments of Bogotá have invested millions of dollars in proposals that could not transcend to construction for many different reasons. Every single proposal to do projects with this road has generated controversy, commotion and citizen and neighborhood resistance. The proposal of former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa in 2019 was the one that went the furthest— only a few days from being awarded a construction contract—and the one that had the most citizens organizing against it. His administration proposed a “classic” expansion of the BRT network that he has historically defended for the city (TransMilenio)2.  

   

As referenced by Sotomayor et al. (2023) this was a highly contentious project that generated many different sources of opposition: organized citizens, councilmen, national politicians, community-based organizations and many others. Because of different political and participatory deficit, the project led to judicial actions, mainly the following: 

 

1. Community organized against the city of Bogotá claiming collective rights, especially environmental and participatory rights3. 
2. High-Income development Altos de la Cabrera, claiming affectations to their private property4 
3. Senator Rodrigo Lara Restrepo against the City of Bogotá for lack of harmonization between planning instruments, environmental claims, and others5 
4. Environmentalists and Patrimonialists against the project claiming irreparable damages to the city’s patrimonial trees and buildings.6  

 

This challenging panorama faced by the city implied a massive opposition from many different sources, stakeholders and interests. Although they represented different segments of society -including political views- they all came together around the objective of blocking the project.
