	abstract = {No one doubts the power of the majority. It makes the rules and enforces them, and most of us are willing to go along with it, most of the time. But what happens when you're not? What about when the issue is so important to you that you're willing to take on the naysayers? It doesn't matter if you're trying to sell a new product or service, persuade colleagues to try out a new business plan, start a revolution, or simply convince your family where to go for dinner. In all of these cases you're going up against the majority, and more often than not your efforts are going to come up short. Or at least that was the case before Dr. William Crano—an expert in the field of influence—applied the science of persuasion to those moments when you find yourself outnumbered and overmatched. By doing so, he has discovered proven strategies, such as working from the inside and changing the game from subjective preferences to objective decisions, and distilled these strategies and more into an extraordinary collection of rules that radically affect the likelihood of success. The Rules of Influence—the most powerful guide to being persuasive even under the most inhospitable conditions—gives you the tools to overcome overwhelming odds and take back control in every situation.

A new theory of social impact is examined that views social influence as resulting from forces operating in a social force field. It proposes that influence by either a majority or a minority will be a multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of its members. It is suggested that social impact theory offers a general model of social influence processes that integrates previous theoretical formulations and empirical findings and accounts for the reciprocal influence of majorities and minorities. Thus, by viewing social influence as a unitary concept, social impact theory permits comparisons between conformity and innovation and predicts the relative magnitude of their effects.

This study concerns innovation, social pressure exercized by a minority, and tries at the same time to prove that behavioral style is a general source of influence. An objectively blue stimulus is used which two subjects (stooges) out of six call "green" in the experimental groups. When the behavior of the minority is consistent, the number of "green" replies in the experimental groups is significantly higher than in the control group. This change in answer is not only a verbal agreement but corresponds to a change in their perception code, as shown by a color discrimination test. When the minority's behavior is not consistent, its impact on the majority is minimal. Therefore it is the consistent behavioral style of minorities that insures the adoption of their point of view.},

	abstract = {The chapter aims to criticize the postulates underlying the current studies on social influence and discard the one-sided association of social influence with questions and facts related to conformity and deviance. It shows several new directions, both conceptual and experimental, which could lead to an understanding of innovation; and demonstrates the importance of behavior style as a general source of social influence. Power effects and influence effects have been differentiated and have shown that the latter play a specific role in assigning attributes. Intraindividual consistency and interindividual consistency have a vital function in these inferential phenomena. They also have a vital function in processes related to influence. The chapter provides the different ways in which a consensus is arrived at: when the majority partner has a norm and the minority partner is deprived of any norm; when partners are equals and each is in possession of his or her own norm; and when the minority partner has a norm, which he or she opposes to the norm of the majority partner. Because a consensus is a result and a form of treating social conflict, by reducing the variation of inter and intraindividual responses, the chapter also dealt with the modalities of social influence—the dynamics of social conflict. The chapter develops a set of hypotheses and an experimental paradigm that allows beginning a study of innovation and of the influence of minorities on majorities. This is possible regardless of the nature of the norm (implicit or explicit), and that it can occur at the response level as well as the coding level. Special attention has been given to the direction of this influence, distinguishing between approach, avoidance, and polarization in relation to the minority.},

	abstract = {In reaction to the decades of research that tended to assume that social influence is synonymous with conformity, recent work has concentrated on the ability of a minority, by having a system of answers of its own, to influence the majority in the direction of their judgments. A study by Moscovici, Lage and Naffrechoux (1969) demonstrated this phenomenon but found that consistency of response, in the sense of repetition, was necessary for minority influence to be effected. They assumed that repetition was necessary to give the minority judgment the same value as that of the majority and to intensify the conflict that was engendered by the differences in opinion. Our position is that the lack of repetition in that study was construed to mean that the minority did not really have a position in which they were confident. As such, they were discounted. Thus, it is the attribution of consistency and confidence that leads to minority influence, not intensification of the conflict. The present study found that non-repetitious behavior by a minority could be seen as reflecting consistency and confidence and could lead to minority influence provided the inconsistency was patterned with some property of the stimulus. Such ‘inconsistency’ was perceived as favorable and as effective as any other condition and even more effective than one of the repetitious conditions.},

In the third study, individuals served as jurors in each of seven mock trials (both civil and criminal). Half of these groups were required to deliberate to unanimity, the other half being required to deliberate to 2/3 majority. Results indicated that verdicts were not appreciably altered as a result of unanimity vs. non-unanimity requirements. However, unanimity groups were more likely to reach full consensus; their deliberations were characterized by more “conflict”; more opinions were changed as a result of the deliberation process; they reported more confidence in the verdict and tended to feel that justice had been administered.

In a prior study comparing these two processes, devil's advocate appeared to foster thinking that was primarily aimed at cognitive bolstering of the initial viewpoint rather than stimulate divergent thought. While that study left the actual position of the DA unknown, the present study compared conditions where the devil's advocate position was known (and consistent or inconsistent with the assigned position) or unknown. It further utilized quantity and quality of solutions as a dependent measure rather than simply cognitive activity. Results indicated that the authentic minority was superior to all three forms of ‘devil's advocate,’ again underscoring the value and importance of authenticity and the difficulty in cloning such authenticity by role-playing techniques.

Perhaps more importantly, we suggest that the permission to criticize and debate may encourage an atmosphere conducive to idea generation.

A third condition served as a control. This study was conducted both in the United States and in France. Results show the value of both types of instruction, but, in general, debate instructions were superior to traditional brainstorming instructions. Further, these findings hold across both cultures.

In the decades that followed, we concentrated, not so much on persuasion or attitude change, but rather on the value of minority views for the stimulation of divergent thinking. Dissent, as has been repeatedly documented, 'opens' the mind. People search for information, consider more options and, on balance, make better decisions and are more creative. Dissenters, rather than rogues or obstacles, provide value: they liberate people to say what they believe and they stimulate divergent and creative thought even when they are wrong. The implications for group decision making, whether in juries or companies, have been considerable and there is increasing interest in research and in practice for the value of authentic dissent in teams and in creating 'cultures' of innovation.
