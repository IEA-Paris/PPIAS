In periods of crises and especially during a pandemic, the young, people with disabilities, the homeless, or migrants appear even weaker and disproportionately exposed to risks. Covid-19 is no exception, and it quickly affected fragile and marginalized populations at a large scale. Especially salient since the first weeks was the impact of health measures and particularly lockdowns on school education: how to maintain some kind of continuity in teaching? What skills and online tools were mobilized to pursue education by other means? How did parents deal with home schooling while literally experimenting teleworking? In this session, we studied how contents of teaching were affected, with the example of the UK, what factors facilitated or on the contrary made the shift to online teaching more difficult, and how different social groups and types of households coped with home-schooling. On the basis of varied methodological approaches, we also discussed the impact of the pandemic on more specifically disadvantaged populations. Two studies were presented which try to understand the particularities of marginalized Indian communities and Southern African migrants’ experiences of the crisis. Propositions were also made to better take into account and mitigate the overwhelmingly negative consequences of the crisis for disabled people.

This Q&A session on the theme "Education and Marginalised Communities" during the WPRN 21 conference in Paris on December 10th 2021 is based on 6 projects registered in the WPRN database.

### 1. [The impact on Primary Science of the UK’s C-19 school closures](https://wprn.org/item/537352)

Our group is studying the impacts of the UK's two Covid-19 related school closure periods on science teaching and learning at primary schools. Phase 1 was conducted during closure period 1 in spring/summer 2020 and our paper "Widening the divide: the impact of school closures on primary science learning” has been published in SN Social Sciences. Phase 2 was conducted during closure period 2 in early 2021 and our paper " 'It just isn't a priority.' Will primary science learning loss be forgotten?" has since been published in the Journal of Emergent Science. Phase 3 will be conducted during the 2021-22 academic year and will look at the longer-term impacts on science learning and the efficacy of mitigation efforts. We would be delighted to hear from other research groups who may wish to discuss potential partnerships.

### 2. [Teachers' and Students' Adaptation to Emergency Remote Instruction During COVID-19 School Closures](https://wprn.org/item/498252)

The project intends to find out how different populations of teachers and students have been coping with the switch to emergency remote instruction during the COVID-19 epidemic: language teachers and learners, educators in subjects other than language, and instructors and students majoring in linguistics, language teaching, modern languages, translation and interpreting, and related fields. Specifically, it leads to a better understanding of what circumstances, behaviours, attitudes and psychological traits have made it easier to deal with the new reality, what challenges the educators and students have been facing, and what has helped them and their well-being. The participants were answering 435 questions about the circumstances surrounding their transition to remote instruction, their personal experiences, behaviours, attitudes, feelings, physical and mental health, and their personality traits, including both closed- and open-ended questions, which are being subjected to mixed-methods analyses; while the project is thus primarily quantitative in nature, the open responses add a qualitative component.

### 3. [Home Schooling in Diverse Family Settings with Young Children during the First Covid Lockdown in France](https://wprn.org/item/487452)

This study aims at providing better understanding of what mothers, fathers and their young children (under 6 years of age) lived through the Covid-19 lockdown in France, what they experienced as favorable or less favorable moments during this health crisis and the possibly gendered and socially situated activities the most mobilized that emerge from domestic work (educational tasks, care tasks, etc.) as well as the associated emotional feelings for both parents. The results will be compared with regard to demographic and socio-economic variables (gender, age, level of education, housing, employment, etc.). Particular attention is paid to families with young children in situations of disadvantage regarding health and education coping with the many constraints related to the crisis. The data collected on educational and health inequalities according to gender, social affiliation and the territorial location of families aims at implementing a program to reduce inequalities. The data collection (n = 493) was carried out between April 28 and May 29, 2020 through an online survey via a dedicated website and various networks (academic, professional, friendly, family) of the study partners, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. submitted to families with at least one child under the age of six. Data will undergo qualitative as well as quantitative analysis.

### 4. [Disability Under Siege: An Analytical Framework for a Disability-Inclusive COVID-19 Recovery](https://wprn.org/item/407052)

The framework will cover the sectors of Health, Education, Economy/Employment, and Social/Community. It will be produced using participatory methods to ensure that it reflects the priority of disabled people from the Global South. The final framework will be disseminated by the United Nations Partnership for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) to governments, NGOs, Disabled People’s Organisations, and other key stakeholders in the countries where UNPRPD is currently running programmes. The framework will provide a comprehensive toolkit to complete a situational analysis of the impact of COVID-19 response and recovery measures on disabled people, as well as include recommendations for best practice examples and an evidence-based rationale for key measures to ensure disabled people are not marginalised or excluded further as a result of national and international responses to COVID-19.

### 5. [COVID-19 health seeking behaviour in marginalised settings - micro ethnographies from Bengaluru, India](https://wprn.org/item/545652)

This research aims to understand how marginalised communities in urban settings navigate within medical systems and what had been their coping mechanism for an unknown disease/situation. This work uses anthropological lens and ethnographic approach for understanding COVID-19 health seeking behaviour, and how marginalisation impacts health seeking. This is a short duration research (less than 12 months), where two marginalised pockets from the city of Bengaluru are being studied. One is a slum area in the middle of an urban area - which is often termed as sensitive in common parlance; the other site is a peri-urban- both in terms of geography and nature of habitat and livelihood.

### 6. [Researching Migration and Coronavirus in South(ern) Africa (MiCoSa)](https://wprn.org/item/530152)

Researching Migration is good and Coronavirus in Southern Africa Coordination (MiCoSA) is hosted by the Migration and Health Project Southern Africa (maHp) at the African Centre for Migration & Society (ACMS), Wits University, Johannesburg. MiCoSA sets out to explore the political, structural, and social factors influencing the (dis)connections between migration and health governance structures in the context of Covid-19 in South(ern) Africa. This includes consideration of access to Covid-19 vaccines, the role of vaccine passports, and the impacts of border closures on diverse migrant groups - and how to overcome these in the context of a pandemic. In addition, MiCoSA co-ordinates an informal network that brings together migrant-led organisations, non-governmental organisations, international organisations, civil society, activists, lawyers, researchers, government officials and policy advisors who are concerned with the health and well-being of asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants during the Covid-19 pandemic.
