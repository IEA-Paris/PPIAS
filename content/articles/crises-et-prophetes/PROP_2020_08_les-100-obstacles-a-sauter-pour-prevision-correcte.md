### Session 2 - Retour sur expérience : "s'être trompé" et "avoir eu raison" en 2008

The second session takes up the specific case of financial prophecies. Several experts who foresaw the 2008 crisis will be invited to share their experience. These economists developed very early, sometimes in the early 2000s, the conviction of the imminence of a financial disaster. Some extracts from their pre-crisis writings and declarations demonstrate an uncanny prescience. In stark contrast to official forecasters, these contrarian experts experienced the crisis not as a surprise but as the end of a long period of waiting. Even today, they continue to be presented as the “prophets of 2008”. Their presentation will shed light on the following questions: How does a crisis prophesy takes shape and consolidates? How were their warnings received by regulators and investors, the vast majority of whom dismissed the likelihood of a crisis? To what extent their reform proposals have been taken into account after the crisis?
