The transition to sustainable production is both challenging and rewarding. It involves green energy, energy and resource efficiency and a change of mindset to a more circular economy. Where do you start and how do you map and insert your business in the local socio-economic system? Such questions are beyond the expertise of the standard CEO.

“Facility as a Service” is a new approach that addresses this challenge, by facilitating the upstream and downstream of the production cycle: “bring your production unit to our industrial park and we will take care of the “in between”, while you focus on what you are best at”. [Greenlab](https://www.greenlab.dk/) has developed such model and implemented it with success. It builds on the SymbiosisNet™ – a symbiotic energy exchange infrastructure which efficiently supplies and manages the park’s energy flows – in all forms, such as power, heat, and electrofuels – and optimizes resources across sectors in a unique interplay with national infrastructure. SymbiosisNet™ is a replicable system, which will enable global export of the [GreenLab](https://www.greenlab.dk/) platform to other local communities.

Christopher Sorensen, CEO of [Greenlab](https://www.greenlab.dk/), will present what has been achieved in Denmark, and how that can be replicated and adapted in other countries, like France.
