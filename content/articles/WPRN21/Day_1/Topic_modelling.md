The Institute for Comparative Research in Human and Social Sciences has initiated a new project to conduct social analysis of the COVID-19 new coronavirus impact on society. The director of ICR (Muneo Kaigo) is currently heading the project by use of quantitative methods for data analysis and machine learning techniques for content analysis of media related to COVID-19 in Japan. Social surveys and data extraction from social media and traditional media will be used. The aim of this project is to clarify the effects of information related to the virus and the impacts on society. Currently, a new study result by the ICR director is in review and is available as a pre-print: SUSPICION BEGETS IDLE FEARS– AN ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 RELATED TOPICS IN JAPANESE MEDIA AND TWITTER The purpose of this study is to examine how content about the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak changed in the Japanese information environment through a comparison of the topics that were prevalent in traditional media and social media. The paper investigated how the topics of information regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in newspapers and Twitter differed, how the topics in relation to COVID-19 of newspapers and Twitter users changed before and after the WHO pandemic declaration, with the assumptions that topics that are relevant to the central government of Japan are more often found in newspapers, rather than Twitter and topics that are relevant to Japanese families and individuals are more often found in Twitter, rather than newspapers. A total of 10953 newspaper articles and 171,996 tweets before and after the pandemic declaration by the WHO.
