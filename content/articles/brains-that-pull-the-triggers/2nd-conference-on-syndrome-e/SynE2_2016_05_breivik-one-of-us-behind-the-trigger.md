I will present a case study of the life of Anders Behring Breivik, who on July 22nd 2011 placed a bomb outside the office of Norway’s Prime Minister, killing 8, before he drove to the island of Utøya where the Labour Party Youth had gathered, and shot 69 teenagers dead.

What is the background of this man, who until that killing spree, never showed signs of aggression? He never fought, he was never violent, but was seen as a very well behaved young man.

When you look at his background, you find a family with a history of psychiatric diagnosis, and when he and his mother was to be examined because of their troubles at the Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, when the boy was four years old, there was a clear recommendation from psychiatrists that the boy should be taken away from his mother, as she was damaging to him.

That did not happen, and the boy goes starts his school years trying to find a place to belong. His search is desperate and always ends with him feeling rejected. How does this feeling rejection, feeling of humiliation, and his psychiatric history makes him into the most lethal solo-terrorist of our time? When does the personal become political?

I will also go into how he prepares himself to kill, using meditation, drugs, training, but most importantly, decides to think like a soldier, because at war you are allowed to kill.
