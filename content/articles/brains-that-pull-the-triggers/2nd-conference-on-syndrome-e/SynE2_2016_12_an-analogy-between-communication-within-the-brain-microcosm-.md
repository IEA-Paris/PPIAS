An epileptic seizure is a phenomenon characterized by an excess of communication between distant brain areas. This hyper-synchronization is associated with a loss of information complexity, and with a de différentiation between these distinct brain areas.

Hyper-communication, loss of complexity, loss of differentiation: the combination of these three properties is reminiscent of many symptoms of world globalization like for instance the stereotyped shopping streets that eventually all look alike across countries and continents. Using this analogy, - and exploring its limits -, I will propose that the functional architecture of our societies conveys both a potential of global consciousness never reached before, but also a vulnerability that can be described as a macrocosmic epileptic loss of consciousness. This analogy can be applied to new forms of societal violence.
