The Paris Institute for Advanced Study supports high-level, innovative research aimed at furthering our knowledge of human beings and society. It gives researchers from all over the world the opportunity freely to conduct a project while benefiting from the academic and intellectual resources at their disposal in Paris. Curiosity, freedom, and dialogue are the core principles guiding their work.

Principally focused on the humanities and social sciences, the Institute is also open to the natural sciences and the creative arts, thus encouraging interdisciplinary work that crosses the boundaries of current knowledge. In the same spirit, it creates links between civil society and the academic world by organizing lectures and debates with renowned academics.

Your gift to the Paris IAS will make it possible to develop new research that is essential to a better understanding of the world and which addresses its most pressing societal challenges. It will support the internationalization of knowledge, enhance the standing of French research abroad, and help us to communicate the latest discoveries to the general public.
