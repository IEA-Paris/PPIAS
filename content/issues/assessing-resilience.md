Over the past few months, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that resilience at all levels is an absolute necessity. Faced with not only pandemics but many other risks, today and in the near future, public and private actors must act and invest towards this objective.

​The [Paris IAS](https://en.assessingresilience.org), the [EIVP](https://en.assessingresilience.org) and the City of Paris have been cooperating since October 2019 on a "Resilience and Territorial Innovation" cycle. Monthly events have been organized on this multidimensional theme, bringing together academics, local authorities and practitioners from diverse fields. On 15th-17th July, all types of actors are invited to reflect together on a particularly important topic.

​Baseline evaluation, monitoring and steering, and impact assessment are crucial but complex processes, especially in projects of territorial innovations for resilience. The "Assessing territorial resilience" international conference will feature keynotes by experts of various disciplines as well as stakeholder case studies to take stock of existing knowledge and share best practices.

​The conference was held online over three half-days, from July 15th to 17th 2020.
