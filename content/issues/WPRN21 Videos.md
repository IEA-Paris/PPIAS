With over 1,000 registered research projects and initiatives, the online platform of the World Pandemic Research Network is the first tool enabling the community working on the on the human, economic, and societal impacts of Covid-19 to showcase, access and discuss projects.

Almost two years after the beginning of the pandemic, the World Pandemic Research Network will host the first international online conference on the human, societal, economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic which will take place fully remotely on 9-10 December 2021. #WPRN21 is the first international forum for researchers and practitioners from all areas of expertise and backgrounds working on the human, economic, and societal impacts of Covid-19, giving them the opportunity to present ongoing projects, share and disseminate insights and results, and to make connections for future collaboration. WPRN is where the community meets.

The WPRN21 conference is supported by the [Fondation Maison des Sciences de lâ€™Homme](https://www.fmsh.fr/en).
