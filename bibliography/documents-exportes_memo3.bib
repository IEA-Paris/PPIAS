	abstract = {A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants’ basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9\% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7\% moderate anxiety, and 21.3\% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = 0.810, 95\% CI = 0.709 - 0.925), family income stability (OR = 0.726, 95\% CI = 0.645 - 0.817) and living with parents (OR = 0.752, 95\% CI = 0.596 - 0.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95\% CI = 2.377 - 3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P {\textless} .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P {\textless} .001). It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics.},

	abstract = {To understand different aspects of community responses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 population-based, random telephone surveys were conducted in June 2003 and January 2004 in Hong Kong. More than 70\% of respondents would avoid visiting hospitals or mainland China to avoid contracting SARS. Most respondents believed that SARS could be transmitted through droplets, fomites, sewage, and animals. More than 90\% believed that public health measures were efficacious means of prevention; 40.4\% believed that SARS would resurge in Hong Kong; and ≈70\% would then wear masks in public places. High percentages of respondents felt helpless, horrified, and apprehensive because of SARS. Approximately 16\% showed signs of posttraumatic symptoms, and ≈40\% perceived increased stress in family or work settings. The general public in Hong Kong has been very vigilant about SARS but needs to be more psychologically prepared to face a resurgence of the epidemic.},
