	abstract = {In response to the Covid-19 pandemic citizens around the globe were urged to practice social distancing. Although many complied, not everyone did. These violations led to sharp moral outrage about the alleged immoral behavior. However, it is an open question whether violators fully realized the severity of the virus threat. We therefore surveyed (n = 1657) to what extent people condemned social distancing rules violations, to what extent they respected these rules, and how likely they felt that not respecting the rules would get them and others infected. Results indicated that people who respect social distancing less and find these violations more permissible also believe that the virus is less likely to infect them or others. This implies that violators do not necessarily care less about others; they simply see the virus as less threatening. Therefore, caution is needed when attributing social distancing violations to a lack of moral character.},

	abstract = {This study uses the theory of planned behavior as a framework to predict intentions of social distancing violation and past non-compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for the effects of intolerance of uncertainty and sociodemographic variables. A total of 2,056 Brazilian participants completed measures on attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, and perceived behavioral control toward social distancing and answered about their political ideology, income, professional status, gender, and age. Our findings indicate that positive attitudes toward complying with physical distancing, strong descriptive norms using ingroup members as referents, and weaker perceived behavioral control over breaching social distancing predict stronger intentionsof adhering to it and actual adherence. Besides, individuals who support right-wing parties, earn lower wages, are students, unemployed, young, and male are more prone to stronger intentions of violating this preventive measure. We suggest designing interventions that foster positive attitudes toward social distancing and address the negative consequences that non-compliance can cause to ingroup members to persuade individuals to stay at home. We also discuss the need for support from prominent political figures and provide evidence to the relevance of investing in conditional cash transfer programs to increase adherence to this preventive measure.},
