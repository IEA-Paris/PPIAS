	abstract = {We introduce quantitative text analysis, an exciting new set of tools for social scientists working on Japan
and in Japanese. First, we explain why these methodologies are useful in attempting to answer questions of substantive interest. Second, we outline the workflow of the typical project that employs quantitative text analysis, paying particular attention to how texts written in the Japanese language can be handled at each stage. Third, we provide an overview of the statistical models most commonly used by political scientists working with text and demonstrate that, with the adjustments we identify, they can be readily applied to Japanese-language texts.
Finally, we point out challenges, including the relative absence of adequate investment in large-scale, publicly available data collections and a sparsity of methodological training. The discipline of political science in Japan will need to grapple with these issues to enable the use of these tools to become as widespread as they are elsewhere.},

	abstract = {quanteda is an R package providing a comprehensive workflow and toolkit for natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, analysis, and visualization. It has extensive functions for applying dictionary analysis, exploring texts using keywords-in-context, computing document and feature similarities, and discovering multi-word expressions through collocation scoring. Based entirely on sparse operations, it provides highly efficient methods for compiling document-feature matrices and for manipulating these or using them in further quantitative analysis. Using C++ and multi threading extensively, quanteda is also considerably faster and more efficient than other R and Python packages in processing large textual data.
The package is designed for R users needing to apply natural language processing to texts, from documents to final analysis. Its capabilities match or exceed those provided in many
end-user software applications, many of which are expensive and not open source. The package is therefore of great benefit to researchers, students, and other analysts with fewer
financial resources. While using quanteda requires R programming knowledge, its API is designed to enable powerful, efficient analysis with a minimum of steps. By emphasizing consistent design, furthermore, quanteda lowers the barriers to learning and using NLP
and quantitative text analysis even for proficient R programmers.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the role of social media during mid-level disruptions by natural disasters through examining the case of the city of Tsukuba in Ibaraki prefecture during the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011. Tsukuba city was relatively unharmed in comparison to much of the devastation of northeastern Japan, however damage was widespread as Tsukuba lost electricity and water immediately after the initial earthquake. Due to heavy congestion, communications became inaccessible for the first few hours after. Power outages did not allow usage of traditional media other than portable radios, and Internet access through personal computers were also unavailable. In this situation, web-enabled phones and smartphones became the primary devices for media access after the initial March 11, 2011 quake. The municipal government of Tsukuba had been experimenting the usage of Twitter for communicating with the citizens of Tsukuba prior to the earthquake, and this platform played a significant role in disseminating vital information during the disaster. This paper also investigates how social capital may have been prominently formed through this interaction with Twitter during the disaster in Tsukuba.},

	abstract = {According to our study of “Public Risk Cognition of Pandemic Flu and Risk Communication” conducted in November 2008, we found that it's extremely important to understand how people recognize Pandemic Flu(H5N1 type) and which way of risk communication is required. As novel H1N1 flu(Swine flu) virus caused outbreaks in April 2009, it was proven that Japanese government's risk and crisis management response and risk communication strategy didn't work well. Fortunately H1N1 flu virus was as severe as seasonal influenza. However, learning from this time's H1N1 pandemic, we've found it urgent to consolidate Japanese government's risk communication strategy for the event of a second wave of H1N1 and prospective outbreaks of highly-virulent H5N1. Our study should give much valuable suggestions to planning of the strategy.},
