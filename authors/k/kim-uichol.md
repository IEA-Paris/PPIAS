      To communicate to a transdisciplinary audience, I have used a conversation
      style reducing the technical terminology and excessive referencing. To aid
      in understanding of the phenomenology and context, I have used figures,
      diagrams, paintings, and photos. These photos, paintings, and diagrams
      have been accessed from the public domain (e.g., wikipedia.org) and old
      photos and paintings that are not copyrighted). Parts of this are based on
      Kim and Kim (1995, 1999, 2001; Kim & Kim; 2022, 2023) articles.
